## 3.5 Control Flow





### if Expressions



Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```



It’s also worth noting that the condition in this code *must* be a `bool`. If the condition isn’t a `bool`, we’ll get an error. 



Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number {
        println!("number was three");
    }
}
```

The `if` condition evaluates to a value of `3` this time, and Rust throws an error:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:4:8
  |
4 |     if number {
  |        ^^^^^^ expected `bool`, found integer
...
```



If we want the `if` code block to run only when a number is not equal to `0`:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number != 0 {
        println!("number was something other than zero");
    }
}
```

Running this code will print `number was something other than zero`.





#### [Handling Multiple Conditions with `else if`](https://rustwiki.org/en/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#handling-multiple-conditions-with-else-if)



Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```



After running it, you should see the following output:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
number is divisible by 3
```



Using too many `else if` expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful Rust branching construct called `match` for these cases.







#### [Using `if` in a `let` Statement]()



Because `if` is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a `let` statement, as in Listing 3-2.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}

// 5
```



The values that have the potential to be results from each arm of the `if` must be the same type.





in Listing 3-2, the results of both the `if` arm and the `else` arm were `i32` integers. If the types are mismatched, as in the following example, we’ll get an error:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```



The `if` and `else` arms have value types that are incompatible, and Rust indicates exactly where to find the problem in the program:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
error[E0308]: `if` and `else` have incompatible types
 --> src/main.rs:4:44
  |
4 |     let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };
  |                                 -          ^^^^^ expected integer, found `&str`
  |                                 |
  |                                 expected because of this

error: aborting due to previous error
```





### [Repetition with Loops]()



To experiment with loops, let’s make a new project called *loops*.

Rust has three kinds of loops: `loop`, `while`, and `for`. 





#### [Repeating Code with `loop`]()

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

 try:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.29s
     Running `target/debug/loops`
again!
again!
again!
again!
^Cagain!
```



You can place the `break` keyword within the loop to tell the program when to stop executing the loop.





#### [Returning Values from Loops]()

One of the uses of a `loop` is to retry an operation you know might fail, such as checking whether a thread has completed its job. However, you might need to pass the result of that operation to the rest of your code. 

as shown here:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {}", result);
}
```

Before the loop, we declare a variable named `counter` and initialize it to `0`. Then we declare a variable named `result` to hold the value returned from the loop. On every iteration of the loop, we add `1` to the `counter` variable, and then check whether the counter is equal to `10`. When it is, we use the `break` keyword with the value `counter * 2`. After the loop, we use a semicolon to end the statement that assigns the value to `result`. Finally, we print the value in `result`, which in this case is 20.





#### [Conditional Loops with `while`]()

Listing 3-3 uses `while`: the program loops three times, counting down each time, and then, after the loop, it prints another message and exits.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

Listing 3-3: Using a `while` loop to run code while a condition holds true

This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used `loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`, and it’s clearer. 





#### [Looping Through a Collection with `for`]()

You could use the `while` construct to loop over the elements of a collection, such as an array:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}
```

Listing 3-4: Looping through each element of a collection using a `while` loop





As a more concise alternative, you can use a `for` loop and execute some code for each item in a collection.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
}
```

Listing 3-5: Looping through each element of a collection using a `for` loop



Even in situations in which you want to run some code a certain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a `while` loop in Listing 3-3, most human would use a `for` loop. The way to do that would be to use a `Range`.

Here’s what the countdown would look like using a `for` loop and another method we’ve not yet talked about, `rev`, to reverse the range:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{}!", number);
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
