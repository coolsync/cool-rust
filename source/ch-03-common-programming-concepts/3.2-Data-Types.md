## Data Types





Two data type subsets: scalar and compound.





### scalar types

Rust has four primary scalar types: 

**integers**, 

**floating-point numbers**, 

**Booleans**, 

and **characters**. 







#### Integer Types

An *integer* is a number without a fractional(部分) component.



Table 3-1: Integer Types in Rust

| Length  | Signed  | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| 8-bit   | `i8`    | `u8`     |
| 16-bit  | `i16`   | `u16`    |
| 32-bit  | `i32`   | `u32`    |
| 64-bit  | `i64`   | `u64`    |
| 128-bit | `i128`  | `u128`   |
| arch    | `isize` | `usize`  |





Signed numbers are stored using [two’s complement]() (二进制补码)representation





Each signed variant can store numbers: 	 `-(2^n-1) to 2^n-1 - 1` 

`i8` can store numbers from -(2^7) to 2^7 - 1  which equal -128 to 127



Unsigned variants can store numbers from `0 to 2^n - 1`,	

so a `u8` can store numbers from 0 to 2^8 - 1, which equals 0 to 255





the `isize` and `usize` types : 

64 bits on a 64-bit architecture, 32 bits on a 32-bit architecture.



number literals:	 

`57u8`

`1_000` -->   `1000`



Table 3-2: Integer Literals in Rust

| Number literals  | Example       |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Decimal          | `98_222`      |
| Hex              | `0xff`        |
| Octal            | `0o77`        |
| Binary           | `0b1111_0000` |
| Byte (`u8` only) | `b'A'`        |



integer types default to `i32`,

The primary situation in which you’d use `isize` or `usize` is when indexing some sort of collection.





```
Integer Overflow

you have a variable of type u8 that can hold values between 0 and 255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside of that range, such as 256, integer overflow will occur.


When you’re compiling in debug mode	--> panic

When you’re compiling in release mode with the --release flag	--> two’s complement wrapping
In the case of a u8, 256 becomes 0, 257 becomes 1, and so on. 


To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, use these families of methods:

wrapping_add ---> wrapping_* methods
Return the None value ---> checked_* methods
Return the value and a boolean ---> overflowing_* methods
Saturate at the value's minimum or maximum values ---> saturating_* methods


```





#### Float type



The `f32` type is a single-precision float, and `f64` has double precision.



Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```







#### Numeric Operations



basic mathematical operations :	

addition, 

subtraction, 

multiplication, 

division, 

and remainder. 



Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;			// 商, 商数

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```







#### Boolean Type



`true` and `false`, Booleans are one byte in size. 





Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```





#### Character Type



`char` literals are specified with single quotes, string literals, which use double quotes.



Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z = 'ℤ';
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}
```



Rust’s `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. 



Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid `char` values in Rust. 



Unicode Scalar Values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive.

### Compound Types



*Compound types* can group multiple values into one type. 

Two primitive compound types: **tuples** and **arrays**.





#### Tuple type



A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type.

元组是将具有多种类型的多个值组合成一个复合类型的一般方法.



Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.





Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```



To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```



we can access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed by the index of the value we want to access. For example:



Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```





#### Array Type

Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. 

Arrays in Rust have a fixed length, like tuples.



In Rust, the values going into an array are written as a comma-separated list inside square brackets:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```



Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap (we will discuss the stack and the heap more in Chapter 4) or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements. 



A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that *is* allowed to grow or shrink in size.

If you’re unsure whether to use an array or a vector, you should probably use a vector.  -->> slice



An example of when you might want to use an array rather than a vector is in a program that needs to know the names of the months of the year, because you know it will always contain 12 elements:

```rust
let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
              "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
```



You would write an array’s type by using square brackets:

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Here, `i32` is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number `5` indicates the array contains five elements.





```rust
let a = [3; 5];
```

The array named `a` will contain `5` elements that will all be set to the value `3` initially. This is the same as writing `let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];` but in a more concise way.





##### Access Array Elements



An array is a single chunk of memory allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing, like this:



Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```





##### Invalid Array Element Access





Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!("Please enter an array index.");

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()			// handle io operation error
        .read_line(&mut index)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let index: usize = index		// Determine whether it is a number
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect("Index entered was not a number");

    let element = a[index];

    println!(
        "The value of the element at index {} is: {}",
        index, element
    );
}
```



If you instead enter a number past the end of the array, such as 10, you'll see output like this:

```console
thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src/main.rs:19:19
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```
