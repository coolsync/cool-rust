## 3.3 Functions



Rust code uses *snake case* as the conventional style for function and variable names. 



Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```



### [Function Parameters]()



Technically, the concrete values are called *arguments*



The following rewritten version of `another_function` shows what parameters look like in Rust:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```



When you want a function to have multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5, 6);
}

fn another_function(x: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```







### [Function Bodies Contain Statements and Expressions]()



 Rust is an expression-based language





 In Listing 3-1, `let y = 6;` is a statement.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}
```

Listing 3-1: A `main` function declaration containing one statement

Function definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a statement in itself.





you can’t assign a `let` statement to another variable, as the following code tries to do; you’ll get an error:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}
```

When you run this program, the error you’ll get looks like this:

The `let y = 6` statement does not return a value, so there isn’t anything for `x` to bind to.







**Expressions can be part of statements**: in Listing 3-1, the `6` in the statement `let y = 6;` is an expression that evaluates to the value `6`. Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression. The block that we use to create new scopes, `{}`, is an expression, for example:



Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);	// 4
}
```

This expression:

```rust
{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
```



 Expressions do not include ending semicolons.







### [Functions with Return Values]()



We don’t name return values, but we do declare their type after an arrow (`->`).



a function that returns a value:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);	// 5
}
```



Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```



Running this code will print `The value of x is: 6`. 



But if we place a semicolon at the end of the line containing `x + 1`, changing it from an expression to a statement, we’ll get an error.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1;
}
```



Compiling this code produces an error, as follows:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:7:24
  |
7 | fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
  |    --------            ^^^ expected `i32`, found `()`
  |    |
  |    implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression
8 |     x + 1;
  |          - help: consider removing this semicolon

error: aborting due to previous error

...
```

The main error message, “**mismatched types**,” reveals the core issue with this code. 



The definition of the function `plus_one` says that it will return an `i32`, but statements don’t evaluate to a value, which is expressed by `()`, an empty tuple. Therefore, nothing is returned, which contradicts the function definition and results in an error.
