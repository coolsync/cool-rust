## [4.1 What Is Ownership?]()



Some languages have garbage collection that constantly looks for no longer used memory as the program runs;



Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time.





**The Stack and the Heap**



The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This is referred to as *last in, first out*. 

Adding data is called *pushing onto the stack*, and removing data is called *popping off the stack*.



All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size.

Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead. 



The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space.

The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a *pointer*, which is the address of that location.



Pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating. Because the pointer is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer.



Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused data on the heap so you donâ€™t run out of space are all problems that ownership addresses.
